# My Favorite Wines

This simple web app allows user to keep track of their favorite (and not so favorite) wines. A user is able to create an account, either by setting their email and password or authenticating through Github, add new wines and ratings, edit wines and ratings they created, and logout.  

This is my Rails Portfolio Project for Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development course.
